expanded.description=A domain name uniquely identifies an Internet Protocol (IP) resource such as a web site on the Internet. Domains are based on the Domain Name System (DNS). Through ICANN, domain names can be registered and resold. Their use in commerce subjects them to Trademark Law. In 2010, the total number of active domain registrations reached 196 million. Peaking at more than 83.6 billion lookup-ups per day,[2] domain name lookups represent a small fraction of the Internet's traffic. DNS organizes domains in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless.
