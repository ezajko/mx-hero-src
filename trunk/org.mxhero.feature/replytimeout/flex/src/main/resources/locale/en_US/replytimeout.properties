explain.client.support=Email client support
explain.client.support.text=If users have email clients with mxHero client side support, then they should use that interface to set reply timeouts on a per email basis.
explain.subject.shortcode=Subject line shortcode
explain.subject.shortcode.text=Users can set reply timeouts by adding a shortcode to the email subject line. Shortcodes are removed before being sent to recipients. Timeouts are only applied to recipients on the TO line and not to recipients on the CC or BCC lines.\n\nExample 1:\n\nSubject: [mxreply 2h] Meeting about project\n -Would set a 2 hour reply timeout for all 'TO' recipients.-\n\nThe short code, *mxreply*, should be surrounded by matching [ ]  (braces).\n\nThe time units available:\n * h - mm/dd or dd/mm\n * h - hours\n * d - days\n\nExample 2:\n\nSubject: Status of project [mxrt 15/3]\n -Would send a notification if recipients do not respond by the 15th of March.-
