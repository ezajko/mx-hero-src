enhancedbcc.label=Enhanced BCC
enhancedbcc.description=Automatically copy originally blind copied (Bcc) recipients on reply email.
enhancedbcc.explain=When a user blind copies an email to other addresses, any reply email from the declared recipients (To/Cc) will not include the originally Bcc'd recipients. This plugin will maintain those recipients in blind copy. In this way, the original sender does not need to forward responses to originally Bcc'd recipients.
